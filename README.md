# todoApp

This SPA (Single Page Application) allows the user to create tasks that we must carry out. They can be stored in folders in order to separate them by type. In addition, we can mark if the task was completed or we can edit its name and also remove it from its folder. Finally, we can delete a folder and by doing this we will delete all the tasks that made it up.

To make this application, I use differents technologies:

## Front-end: 

•	React ^17.0.2

•	Redux ^4.1.2

• CSS

• HTML


## Back-end


• Node js v16.13.0

• Nest js

• PostgreSQL v14.1



# How it's work?

The back-end is deployed with Heroku in the following link: https://todoappnest.herokuapp.com

And the front-end is deployed with vercel in the following link: https://todo-app-nest-juanhuarte.vercel.app

Once you access to the second link you will see the login page

And if you don't have and account you can create one using a controlled form

I have created for you the following user: 

• user: todo@ensolvers.com

• password: Ensolvers1234

After you login you will see the home page where you can logout, view your folders and task, and also create or delete both.

Also by clicking "edit" you can edit your task by changing their name

Finally this SPA is fully responsive, you can use it on your desktop, your tablet or your phone.

I just wanted to add that there are some things that were not implemented in the front like being able to delete and edit the user account and also editing the folder name but the routes in the back are working propertly.
